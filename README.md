# About Me
Im kind of a person who dedicated his life to computer technology and it's varieties. I believe that you can't depend on luck for the quality. I try to improve myself in every chance that I get and revise myself to be better at the things that I do.

> If you can only do one thing, hone it to perfection. Hone it to the utmost limit.
